					<b>I love to visit museums and to think of how people feel while looking at things from the past. I love to be transported to a time where there were no computers and imagine what kinds of thing I would do instead of coding. Perhaps, I would paint impressionist art or write music.</b>

				<h2>A dream</h2>
				<blockquote>
				 <i> I always dream that someday I will go to space and explore the planetary system here around home and in other systems. I am extremely excite about the new mission to fly by <a href="https://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AwrBT8r6zhNX3iUAV.BXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEwcTc4aWkwBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNxc3MtcXJ3?type=671737&fr=spigot-yhp-sfmac&ei=UTF-8&p=alpha+centauri&fr2=12642" target="_blank">Alpha Centauri</a> and know that I will be around ( 20 years from now ) to see pictures/video/media coming from so far away!

				<p>
				One of the things I love about coding is the ability to do what ever I want. For instance, the other day I wrote a javascript file that would go over the CAT's DNA genome and visualize the sequence of amino acids by assigning a color to each and then drawing a box with the respective order in a sequence.</p>
